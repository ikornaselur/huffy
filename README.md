# Huffy

How does compression work? Well it depends on a lot of things.. Lossless?
Lossy? What type of content is being compressed? There are multiple different
algorithms available as well.. those are the initial answers I got when looking
up how compressions works.

[Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) is a type of
coding commonly used for lossless data compressions, so I thought it would be a
good place to start. Best way to learn how something works is just to implement
it!

So that's what this is for, it's just a playground to test implementing Huffman
coding on binary files. By no means should this be used for anything real!
